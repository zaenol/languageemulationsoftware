You may not disclose the results of any benchmark test of Software to any third party without Zion's prior written approval.

You agree by your installation and use of this copy of Software or Key to terminate your earlier license and discontinue use of the earlier version of Software or Key and agree not to transfer it to another. You understand and agree that as part of a check-for-updates feature, the Software may transmit certain information pertaining to the Software to Zion Software electronically and automatically.  For example, the Software may transmit the Software product name, version, build number, OS name, OS version, and Java version, country and language that the Software is being run on to Zion Software.

Zion will use reasonable commercial efforts to, at its option, supply you with a replacement copy of Software that substantially conforms to the documentation, or refund to you your purchase price for Software if any. Zion shall have no responsibility if Software or Key has been altered in any way, or if the failure arises out of use of Software with unauthorized Keys or with other than a recommended hardware configuration.

8. Limitations of Damages
ZION SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS, OR THE LIKE), WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF ZION OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. ZION'S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT RECEIVED BY ZION FROM YOUR PURCHASE OF A KEY FOR SOFTWARE THAT CAUSED SUCH DAMAGE. (USA only) SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
